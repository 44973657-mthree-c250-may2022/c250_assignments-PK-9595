      "I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its\n",
      "nature clearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in\n",
      "Space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles,\n",
      "Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining\n",
      "fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface, but\n",
      "without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like\n",
      "shadows--only hard with luminous edges--and you will then have a pretty\n",
      "correct notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas, a few years ago, I\n",
      "should have said \"my universe:\"  but now my mind has been opened to\n",
      "higher views of things.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that\n",
      "there should be anything of what you call a \"solid\" kind; but I dare\n",
      "say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the\n",
      "Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described\n",
      "them.  On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least\n",
      "so as to distinguish one figure from another.  Nothing was visible, nor\n",
      "could be visible, to us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of\n",
      "this I will speedily demonstrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning\n",
      "over it, look down upon it.  It will appear a circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your\n",
      "eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the\n",
      "inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and\n",
      "more oval to your view, and at last when you have placed your eye\n",
      "exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually\n",
      "a Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all,\n",
      "and will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a\n",
      "Triangle, or a Square, or any other figure cut out from pasteboard.  As\n",
      "soon as you look at it with your eye on the edge of the table, you will\n",
      "find that it ceases to appear to you as a figure, and that it becomes\n",
      "in appearance a straight line.  Take for example an equilateral\n",
      "Triangle--who represents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class.\n",
      "Figure 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were\n",
      "bending over him from above; figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman,\n",
      "as you would see him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on\n",
      "the level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level of the\n",
      "table (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing\n",
      "but a straight line.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar\n",
      "experiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant\n",
      "island or coast lying on the horizon.  The far-off land may have bays,\n",
      "forelands, angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a\n",
      "distance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright\n",
      "upon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light\n",
      "and shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other\n",
      "acquaintances comes towards us in Flatland.  As there is neither sun\n",
      "with us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none\n",
      "of the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland.  If our friend\n",
      "comes closer to us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it\n",
      "becomes smaller; but still he looks like a straight line; be he a\n",
      "Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will--a straight\n",
      "Line he looks and nothing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantagous circumstances we are\n",
      "able to distinguish our friends from one another: but the answer to\n",
      "this very natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I\n",
      "come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland.  For the present let me\n",
      "defer this subject, and say a word or two about the climate and houses\n",
      "in our country.\n",

      "\n",
      "As with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass\n",
      "North, South, East, and West.\n",
      "\n",
      "There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us\n",
      "to determine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our\n",
      "own.  By a Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the\n",
      "South; and, although in temperate climates this is very slight--so that\n",
      "even a Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs\n",
      "northward without much difficulty--yet the hampering effort of the\n",
      "southward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most\n",
      "parts of our earth.  Moreover, the rain (which falls at stated\n",
      "intervals) coming always from the North, is an additional assistance;\n",
      "and in the towns we have the guidance of the houses, which of course\n",
      "have their side-walls running for the most part North and South, so\n",
      "that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North.  In the country,\n",
      "where there are no houses, the trunks of the trees serve as some sort\n",
      "of guide.  Altogether, we have not so much difficulty as might be\n",
      "expected in determining our bearings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward attraction is\n",
      "hardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where\n",
      "there have been no houses nor trees to guide me, I have been\n",
      "occasionally compelled to remain stationary for hours together, waiting\n",
      "till the rain came before continuing my journey.  On the weak and aged,\n",
      "and especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction tells much\n",
      "more heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex, so that it is a point\n",
      "of breeding, if you meet a Lady on the street, always to give her the\n",
      "North side of the way--by no means an easy thing to do always at short\n",
      "notice when you are in rude health and in a climate where it is\n",
      "difficult to tell your North from your South.\n",
      "\n",
      "Windows there are none in our houses:  for the light comes to us alike\n",
      "in our homes and out of them, by day and by night, equally at all times\n",
      "and in all places, whence we know not.  It was in old days, with our\n",
      "learned men, an interesting and oft-investigate question, \"What is the\n",
      "origin of light?\" and the solution of it has been repeatedly attempted,\n",
      "with no other result than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the\n",
      "would-be solvers.  Hence, after fruitless attempts to suppress such\n",
      "investigations indirectly by making them liable to a heavy tax, the\n",
      "Legislature, in comparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them.\n",
      "I--alas, I alone in Flatland--know now only too well the true solution\n",
      "of this mysterious problem; but my knowledge cannot be made\n",
      "intelligible to a single one of my countrymen; and I am mocked at--I,\n",
      "the sole possessor of the truths of Space and of the theory of the\n",
      "introduction of Light from the world of three Dimensions--as if I were\n",
      "the maddest of the mad!  But a truce to these painful digressions:  let\n",
      "me return to our homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common form for the construction of a house is five-sided or\n",
      "pentagonal, as in the annexed figure.  The two Northern sides RO, OF,\n",
      "constitute the roof, and for the most part have no doors; on the East\n",
      "is a small door for the Women; on the West a much larger one for the\n",
      "Men; the South side or floor is usually doorless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason.  The\n",
      "angles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle,)\n",
      "being much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of\n",
      "inanimate objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men\n",
      "and Women, it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of\n",
      "a square or triangular house residence might do serious injury to an\n",
      "inconsiderate or perhaps absentminded traveller suddenly running\n",
      "against them: and therefore, as early as the eleventh century of our\n",
      "era, triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law, the only\n",
      "exceptions being fortifications, powder-magazines, barracks, and other\n",
      "state buildings, which is not desirable that the general public should\n",
      "approach without circumspection.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this period, square houses were still everywhere permitted, though\n",
      "discouraged by a special tax.  But, about three centuries afterwards,\n",
      "the Law decided that in all towns containing a population above ten\n",
      "thousand, the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house-angle that\n",
      "could be allowed consistently with the public safety.  The good sense\n",
      "of the community has seconded the efforts of the Legislature; and now,\n",
      "even in the country, the pentagonal construction has superseded every\n",
      "other.  It is only now and then in some very remote and backward\n",

      "The greatest length or breadth of a full grown inhabitant of Flatland\n",
      "may be estimated at about eleven of your inches.  Twelve inches may be\n",
      "regarded as a maximum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Women are Straight Lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Soldiers and Lowest Class of Workmen are Triangles with two equal\n",
      "sides, each about eleven inches long, and a base or third side so short\n",
      "(often not exceeding half an inch) that they form at their vertices a\n",
      "very sharp and formidable angle.  Indeed when their bases are of the\n",
      "most degraded type (not more than the eighth part of an inch in size),\n",
      "they can hardly be distinguished from Straight lines or Women; so\n",
      "extremely pointed are their vertices.  With us, as with you, these\n",
      "Triangles are distinguished from others by being called Isosceles; and\n",
      "by this name I shall refer to them in the following pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-Sided Triangles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class I myself\n",
      "belong) and Five-Sided Figures or Pentagons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees,\n",
      "beginning at Six-Sided Figures, or Hexagons, and from thence rising in\n",
      "the number of their sides till they receive the honourable title of\n",
      "Polygonal, or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides becomes\n",
      "so numerous, and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot\n",
      "be distinguished from a circle, he is included in the Circular or\n",
      "Priestly order; and this is the highest class of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have one more\n",
      "side than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule)\n",
      "one step in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a\n",
      "Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this rule applies not always to the Tradesman, and still less often\n",
      "to the Soldiers, and to the Workmen; who indeed can hardly be said to\n",
      "deserve the name of human Figures, since they have not all their sides\n",
      "equal.  With them therefore the Law of Nature does not hold; and the\n",
      "son of an Isosceles (i.e. a Triangle with two sides equal) remains\n",
      "Isosceles still.  Nevertheless, all hope is not such out, even from the\n",
      "Isosceles, that his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded\n",
      "condition.  For, after a long series of military successes, or diligent\n",
      "and skillful labours, it is generally found that the more intelligent\n",
      "among the Artisan and Soldier classes manifest a slight increase of\n",
      "their third side or base, and a shrinkage of the two other sides.\n",
      "Intermarriages (arranged by the Priests) between the sons and daughters\n",
      "of these more intellectual members of the lower classes generally\n",
      "result in an offspring approximating still more to the type of the\n",
      "Equal-Sided Triangle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rarely--in proportion to the vast numbers of Isosceles births--is a\n",
      "genuine and certifiable Equal-Sided Triangle produced from Isosceles\n",
      "parents (footnote 1).  Such a birth requires, as its antecedents, not\n",
      "only a series of carefully arranged intermarriages, but also a\n",
      "long-continued exercise of frugality and self-control on the part of\n",
      "the would-be ancestors of the coming Equilateral, and a patient,\n",
      "systematic, and continuous development of the Isosceles intellect\n",
      "through many generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents is the\n",
      "subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs round.  After a\n",
      "strict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board, the\n",
      "infant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial admitted\n",
      "into the class of Equilaterals.  He is then immediately taken from his\n",
      "proud yet sorrowing parents and adopted by some childless Equilateral,\n",

      "former home or so much as to look upon his relations again, for fear\n",
      "lest the freshly developed organism may, by force of unconscious\n",

      "The occasional emergence of an Equilateral from the ranks of his\n",
      "serf-born ancestors is welcomed, not only by the poor serfs themselves,\n",
      "as a gleam of light and hope shed upon the monotonous squalor of their\n",
      "existence, but also by the Aristocracy at large; for all the higher\n",
      "classes are well aware that these rare phenomena, while they do little\n",
      "or nothing to vulgarize their own privileges, serve as almost useful\n",
      "barrier against revolution from below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception, absolutely\n",
      "destitute of hope and of ambition, they might have found leaders in\n",
      "some of their many seditious outbreaks, so able as to render their\n",
      "superior numbers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the\n",
      "Circles.  But a wise ordinance of Nature has decreed that in proportion\n",
      "as the working-classes increase in intelligence, knowledge, and all\n",
      "virtue, in that same proportion their acute angle (which makes them\n",
      "physically terrible) shall increase also and approximate to their\n",
      "comparatively harmless angle of the Equilateral Triangle.  Thus, in the\n",
      "most brutal and formidable off the soldier class--creatures almost on a\n",
      "level with women in their lack of intelligence--it is found that, as\n",
      "they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremendous\n",

      "aristocratic constitution of the States of Flatland!  By a judicious\n",
      "use of this Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always\n",
      "able to stifle sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the\n",
      "irrepressible and boundless hopefulness of the human mind.  Art also\n",
      "comes to the aid of Law and Order.  It is generally found possible--by\n",
      "a little artificial compression or expansion on the part of the State\n",
      "physicians--to make some of the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion\n",
      "perfectly Regular, and to admit them at once into the privileged\n",
      "classes; a much larger number, who are still below the standard,\n",
      "allured by the prospect of being ultimately ennobled, are induced to\n",
      "enter the State Hospitals, where they are kept in honourable\n",
      "confinement for life; one or two alone of the most obstinate, foolish,\n",
      "and hopelessly irregular are led to execution.\n",

      "If our highly pointed Triangles of the Soldier class are formidable, it\n",

      "if a Soldier is a wedge, a Woman is a needle; being, so to speak, ALL\n",

      "that a Female, in Flatland, is a creature by no means to be trifled\n",
      "with.\n",

      "But here, perhaps, some of my younger Readers may ask HOW a woman in\n",

      "look at it end-ways, and you see nothing but a point, it has become\n",

      "containing her eye or mouth--for with us these two organs are\n",

      "Many are the enactments made at different times in the different States\n",
      "of Flatland, in order to minimize this peril; and in the Southern and\n",
      "less temperate climates, where the force of gravitation is greater, and\n",
      "human beings more liable to casual and involuntary motions, the Laws\n",
      "concerning Women are naturally much more stringent.  But a general view\n",
      "of the Code may be obtained from the following summary:--\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Every house shall have one entrance on the Eastern side, for the\n",
      "use of Females only; by which all females shall enter \"in a becoming\n",
      "and respectful manner\" (footnote 1) and not by the Men's or Western\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  No Female shall walk in any public place without continually\n",
      "keeping up her Peace-cry, under penalty of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Any Female, duly certified to be suffering from St. Vitus's Dance,\n",
      "fits, chronic cold accompanied by violent sneezing, or any disease\n",
      "necessitating involuntary motions, shall be instantly destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some of the States there is an additional Law forbidding Females,\n",
      "under penalty of death, from walking or standing in any public place\n",
      "without moving their backs constantly from right to left so as to\n",
      "indicate their presence to those behind them; others oblige a Woman,\n",
      "when travelling, to be followed by one of her sons, or servants, or by\n",
      "her husband; others confine Women altogether in their houses except\n",
      "during the religious festivals.  But it has been found by the wisest of\n",
      "our Circles or Statesmen that the multiplication of restrictions on\n",
      "Females tends not only to the debilitation and diminution of the race,\n",
      "but also to the increase of domestic murders to such an extent that a\n",
      "State loses more than it gains by a too prohibitive Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "For whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated by confinement\n",
      "at home or hampering regulations abroad, they are apt to vent their\n",
      "spleen upon their husbands and children; and in the less temperate\n",
      "climates the whole male population of a village has been sometimes\n",
      "destroyed in one or two hours of a simultaneous female outbreak.  Hence\n",
      "the Three Laws, mentioned above, suffice for the better regulated\n",
      "States, and may be accepted as a rough exemplification of our Female\n",
      "Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, our principal safeguard is found, not in Legislature, but in\n",
      "the interests of the Women themselves.  For, although they can inflict\n",
      "instantaneous death by a retrograde movement, yet unless they can at\n",
      "once disengage their stinging extremity from the struggling body of\n",
      "their victim, their own frail bodies are liable to be shattered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of Fashion is also on our side.  I pointed out that in some\n",
      "less civilized States no female is suffered to stand in any public\n",
      "place without swaying her back from right to left.  This practice has\n",
      "been universal among ladies of any pretensions to breeding in all\n",
      "well-governed States, as far back as the memory of Figures can reach.\n",
      "It is considered a disgrace to any state that legislation should have\n",
      "to enforce what ought to be, and is in every respectable female, a\n",
      "natural instinct.  The rhythmical and, if I may so say, well-modulated\n",
      "undulation of the back in our ladies of Circular rank is envied and\n",
      "imitated by the wife of a common Equilateral, who can achieve nothing\n",
      "beyond a mere monotonous swing, like the ticking of a pendulum; and the\n",
      "regular tick of the Equilateral is no less admired and copied by the\n",
      "wife of the progressive and aspiring Isosceles, in the females of whose\n",
      "family no \"back-motion\" of any kind has become as yet a necessity of\n",
      "life.  Hence, in every family of position and consideration, \"back\n",
      "motion\" is as prevalent as time itself; and the husbands and sons in\n",
      "these households enjoy immunity at least from invisible attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that it must be for a moment supposed that our Women are destitute\n",
      "of affection.  But unfortunately the passion of the moment\n",
      "predominates, in the Frail Sex, over every other consideration.  This\n",
      "is, of course, a necessity arising from their unfortunate conformation.\n",
      "For as they have no pretensions to an angle, being inferior in this\n",
      "respect to the very lowest of the Isosceles, they are consequently\n",
      "wholly devoid of brainpower, and have neither reflection, judgment nor\n",
      "forethought, and hardly any memory.  Hence, in their fits of fury, they\n",
      "remember no claims and recognize no distinctions.  I have actually\n",
      "known a case where a Woman has exterminated her whole household, and\n",
      "half an hour afterwards, when her rage was over and the fragments swept\n",
      "away, has asked what has become of her husband and children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously then a Woman is not to be irritated as long as she is in a\n",
      "position where she can turn round.  When you have them in their\n",
      "apartments--which are constructed with a view to denying them that\n",
      "power--you can say and do what you like; for they are then wholly\n",
      "impotent for mischief, and will not remember a few minutes hence the\n",
      "incident for which they may be at this moment threatening you with\n",
      "death, nor the promises which you may have found it necessary to make\n",
      "in order to pacify their fury.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the whole we got on pretty smoothly in our domestic relations,\n",
      "except in the lower strata of the Military Classes.  There the want of\n",
      "tact and discretion on the part of the husbands produces at times\n",
      "indescribable disasters.  Relying too much on the offensive weapons of\n",
      "their acute angles instead of the defensive organs of good sense and\n",
      "seasonable simulations, these reckless creatures too often neglect the\n",
      "prescribed construction of the women's apartments, or irritate their\n",
      "wives by ill-advised expressions out of doors, which they refuse\n",
      "immediately to retract.  Moreover a blunt and stolid regard for literal\n",
      "truth indisposes them to make those lavish promises by which the more\n",
      "judicious Circle can in a moment pacify his consort.  The result is\n",
      "massacre; not, however, without its advantages, as it eliminates the\n",
      "more brutal and troublesome of the Isosceles; and by many of our\n",
      "Circles the destructiveness of the Thinner Sex is regarded as one among\n",
      "many providential arrangements for suppressing redundant population,\n",
      "and nipping Revolution in the bud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even in our best regulated and most approximately Circular families\n",
      "I cannot say that the ideal of family life is so high as with you in\n",
      "Spaceland.  There is peace, in so far as the absence of slaughter may\n",
      "be called by that name, but there is necessarily little harmony of\n",
      "tastes or pursuits; and the cautious wisdom of the Circles has ensured\n",
      "safety at the cost of domestic comfort.  In every Circular or Polygonal\n",
      "household it has been a habit from time immemorial--and now has become\n",
      "a kind of instinct among the women of our higher classes--that the\n",
      "mothers and daughters should constantly keep their eyes and mouths\n",
      "towards their husband and his male friends; and for a lady in a family\n",
      "of distinction to turn her back upon her husband would be regarded as a\n",
      "kind of portent, involving loss of STATUS.  But, as I shall soon shew,\n",
      "this custom, though it has the advantage of safety, is not without\n",
      "disadvantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the house of the Working Man or respectable Tradesman--where the\n",
      "wife is allowed to turn her back upon her husband, while pursuing her\n",
      "household avocations--there are at least intervals of quiet, when the\n",
      "wife is neither seen nor heard, except for the humming sound of the\n",
      "continuous Peace-cry; but in the homes of the upper classes there is\n",
      "too often no peace.  There the voluble mouth and bright penetrating eye\n",
      "are ever directed toward the Master of the household; and light itself\n",
      "is not more persistent than the stream of Feminine discourse.  The tact\n",
      "and skill which suffice to avert a Woman's sting are unequal to the\n",
      "task of stopping a Woman's mouth; and as the wife has absolutely\n",
      "nothing to say, and absolutely no constraint of wit, sense, or\n",
      "conscience to prevent her from saying it, not a few cynics have been\n",
      "found to aver that they prefer the danger of the death-dealing but\n",

      "\n",
      "To my readers in Spaceland the condition of our Women may seen truly\n",
      "deplorable, and so indeed it is.  A Male of the lowest type of the\n",

      "SECTION 5  Of our Methods of Recognizing one another\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You, who are blessed with shade as well as light, you, who are gifted\n",
      "with two eyes, endowed with a knowledge of perspective, and charmed\n",
      "with the enjoyment of various colours, you, who can actually SEE an\n",
      "angle, and contemplate the complete circumference of a Circle in the\n",
      "happy region of the Three Dimensions--how shall I make it clear to you\n",
      "the extreme difficulty which we in Flatland experience in recognizing\n",
      "one another's configuration?\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall what I told you above.  All beings in Flatland, animate and\n",
      "inanimate, no matter what their form, present TO OUR VIEW the same, or\n",
      "nearly the same, appearance, viz. that of a straight Line.  How then\n",
      "can one be distinguished from another, where all appear the same?\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is threefold.  The first means of recognition is the sense\n",
      "of hearing; which with us is far more highly developed than with you,\n",
      "and which enables us not only to distinguish by the voice of our\n",
      "personal friends, but even to discriminate between different classes,\n",
      "at least so far as concerns the three lowest orders, the Equilateral,\n",
      "the Square, and the Pentagon--for the Isosceles I take no account.  But\n",
      "as we ascend the social scale, the process of discriminating and being\n",
      "discriminated by hearing increases in difficulty, partly because voices\n",
      "are assimilated, partly because the faculty of voice-discrimination is\n",
      "a plebeian virtue not much developed among the Aristocracy.  And\n",
      "wherever there is any danger of imposture we cannot trust to this\n",
      "method.  Amongst our lowest orders, the vocal organs are developed to a\n",
      "degree more than correspondent with those of hearing, so that an\n",
      "Isosceles can easily feign the voice of a Polygon, and, with some\n",
      "training, that of a Circle himself.  A second method is therefore more\n",
      "commonly resorted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "FEELING is, among our Women and lower classes--about our upper classes\n",
      "I shall speak presently--the principal test of recognition, at all\n",
      "events between strangers, and when the question is, not as to the\n",
      "individual, but as to the class.  What therefore \"introduction\" is\n",
      "among the higher classes in Spaceland, that the process of \"feeling\" is\n",
      "with us.  \"Permit me to ask you to feel and be felt by my friend Mr.\n",
      "So-and-so\"--is still, among the more old-fashioned of our country\n",
      "gentlemen in districts remote from towns, the customary formula for a\n",
      "Flatland introduction.  But in the towns, and among men of business,\n",
      "the words \"be felt by\" are omitted and the sentence is abbreviated to,\n",
      "\"Let me ask you to feel Mr. So-and-so\"; although it is assumed, of\n",
      "course, that the \"feeling\" is to be reciprocal.  Among our still more\n",
      "modern and dashing young gentlemen--who are extremely averse to\n",
      "superfluous effort and supremely indifferent to the purity of their\n",
      "native language--the formula is still further curtailed by the use of\n",
      "\"to feel\" in a technical sense, meaning, \"to\n",
      "recommend-for-the-purposes-of-feeling-and-being-felt\"; and at this\n",
      "moment the \"slang\" of polite or fast society in the upper classes\n",
      "sanctions such a barbarism as \"Mr. Smith, permit me to feel Mr. Jones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let not my Reader however suppose that \"feeling\" is with us the tedious\n",
      "process that it would be with you, or that we find it necessary to feel\n",
      "right round all the sides of every individual before we determine the\n",
      "class to which he belongs.  Long practice and training, begun in the\n",
      "schools and continued in the experience of daily life, enable us to\n",
      "discriminate at once by the sense of touch, between the angles of an\n",
      "equal-sided Triangle, Square, and Pentagon; and I need not say that the\n",
      "brainless vertex of an acute-angled Isosceles is obvious to the dullest\n",
      "touch.  It is therefore not necessary, as a rule, to do more than feel\n",
      "a single angle of an individual; and this, once ascertained, tells us\n",
      "the class of the person whom we are addressing, unless indeed he\n",
      "belongs to the higher sections of the nobility.  There the difficulty\n",
      "is much greater.  Even a Master of Arts in our University of Wentbridge\n",
      "has been known to confuse a ten-sided with a twelve-sided Polygon; and\n",
      "there is hardly a Doctor of Science in or out of that famous University\n",
      "who could pretend to decide promptly and unhesitatingly between a\n",
      "twenty-sided and a twenty-four sided member of the Aristocracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those of my readers who recall the extracts I gave above from the\n",
      "Legislative code concerning Women, will readily perceive that the\n",
      "process of introduction by contact requires some care and discretion.\n",
      "Otherwise the angles might inflict on the unwary Feeling irreparable\n",
      "injury.  It is essential for the safety of the Feeler that the Felt\n",
      "should stand perfectly still.  A start, a fidgety shifting of the\n",
      "position, yes, even a violent sneeze, has been known before now to\n",
      "prove fatal to the incautious, and to nip in the bud many a promising\n",
      "friendship.  Especially is this true among the lower classes of the\n",
      "Triangles.  With them, the eye is situated so far from their vertex\n",
      "that they can scarcely take cognizance of what goes on at that\n",
      "extremity of their frame.  They are, moreover, of a rough coarse\n",
      "nature, not sensitive to the delicate touch of the highly organized\n",
      "Polygon.  What wonder then if an involuntary toss of the head has ere\n",
      "now deprived the State of a valuable life!\n",

      "passing him into the class of the Equal-sided--often deplored, with a\n",

      "occurred to his great-great-great-Grandfather, a respectable Working\n",
      "Man with an angle or brain of 59 degrees 30 minutes.  According to his\n",
      "account, my unfortunately Ancestor, being afflicted with rheumatism,\n",
      "and in the act of being felt by a Polygon, by one sudden start\n",
      "accidentally transfixed the Great Man through the diagonal and thereby,\n",
      "partly in consequence of his long imprisonment and degradation, and\n",
      "partly because of the moral shock which pervaded the whole of my\n",
      "Ancestor's relations, threw back our family a degree and a half in\n",
      "their ascent towards better things.  The result was that in the next\n",
      "generation the family brain was registered at only 58 degrees, and not\n",
      "till the lapse of five generations was the lost ground recovered, the\n",
      "full 60 degrees attained, and the Ascent from the Isosceles finally\n",
      "achieved.  And all this series of calamities from one little accident\n",
      "in the process of Feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this point I think I hear some of my better educated readers\n",
      "exclaim, \"How could you in Flatland know anything about angles and\n",
      "degrees, or minutes?  We SEE an angle, because we, in the region of\n",
      "Space, can see two straight lines inclined to one another; but you, who\n",
      "can see nothing but on straight line at a time, or at all events only a\n",
      "number of bits of straight lines all in one straight line,--how can you\n",
      "ever discern an angle, and much less register angles of different\n",
      "sizes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I answer that though we cannot SEE angles, we can INFER them, and this\n",
      "with great precision.  Our sense of touch, stimulated by necessity, and\n",
      "developed by long training, enables us to distinguish angles far more\n",
      "accurately than your sense of sight, when unaided by a rule or measure\n",
      "of angles.  Nor must I omit to explain that we have great natural\n",
      "helps.  It is with us a Law of Nature that the brain of the Isosceles\n",
      "class shall begin at half a degree, or thirty minutes, and shall\n",
      "increase (if it increases at all) by half a degree in every generation\n",
      "until the goal of 60 degrees is reached, when the condition of serfdom\n",
      "is quitted, and the freeman enters the class of Regulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, Nature herself supplies us with an ascending scale or\n",
      "Alphabet of angles for half a degree up to 60 degrees, Specimen of\n",
      "which are placed in every Elementary School throughout the land.  Owing\n",
      "to occasional retrogressions, to still more frequent moral and\n",
      "intellectual stagnation, and to the extraordinary fecundity of the\n",
      "Criminal and Vagabond classes, there is always a vast superfluity of\n",
      "individuals of the half degree and single degree class, and a fair\n",
      "abundance of Specimens up to 10 degrees.  These are absolutely\n",
      "destitute of civil rights; and a great number of them, not having even\n",
      "intelligence enough for the purposes of warfare, are devoted by the\n",
      "States to the service of education.  Fettered immovably so as to remove\n",
      "all possibility of danger, they are placed in the classrooms of our\n",
      "Infant Schools, and there they are utilized by the Board of Education\n",

      "In some States the Specimens are occasionally fed and suffered to exist\n",

      "regions, it is found in the long run more advantageous for the\n",
      "educational interests of the young, to dispense with food, and to renew\n",
      "the Specimens every month--which is about the average duration of the\n",
      "foodless existence of the Criminal class.  In the cheaper schools, what\n",
      "is gained by the longer existence of the Specimen is lost, partly in\n",
      "the expenditure for food, and partly in the diminished accuracy of the\n",

      "Throughout the previous pages I have been assuming--what perhaps should\n",
      "have been laid down at the beginning as a distinct and fundamental\n",
      "proposition--that every human being in Flatland is a Regular Figure,\n",
      "that is to say of regular construction.  By this I mean that a Woman\n",
      "must not only be a line, but a straight line; that an Artisan or\n",
      "Soldier must have two of his sides equal; that Tradesmen must have\n",
      "three sides equal; Lawyers (of which class I am a humble member), four\n",
      "sides equal, and, generally, that in every Polygon, all the sides must\n",
      "be equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sizes of the sides would of course depend upon the age of the\n",
      "individual.  A Female at birth would be about an inch long, while a\n",
      "tall adult Woman might extend to a foot.  As to the Males of every\n",
      "class, it may be roughly said that the length of an adult's size, when\n",
      "added together, is two feet or a little more.  But the size of our\n",
      "sides is not under consideration.  I am speaking of the EQUALITY of\n",
      "sides, and it does not need much reflection to see that the whole of\n",
      "the social life in Flatland rests upon the fundamental fact that Nature\n",
      "wills all Figures to have their sides equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "If our sides were unequal our angles might be unequal.  Instead of its\n",
      "being sufficient to feel, or estimate by sight, a single angle in order\n",
      "to determine the form of an individual, it would be necessary to\n",
      "ascertain each angle by the experiment of Feeling.  But life would be\n",
      "too short for such a tedious groping.  The whole science and art of\n",
      "Sight Recognition would at once perish; Feeling, so far as it is an\n",
      "art, would not long survive; intercourse would become perilous or\n",
      "impossible; there would be an end to all confidence, all forethought;\n",

      "Am I going too fast to carry my Readers with me to these obvious\n",

      "common life, must convince every one that our social system is based\n",
      "upon Regularity, or Equality of Angles.  You meet, for example, two or\n",
      "three Tradesmen in the street, whom your recognize at once to be\n",

      "with perfect confidence, because everyone knows to an inch or two the\n",
      "area occupied by an adult Triangle: but imagine that your Tradesman\n",
      "drags behind his regular and respectable vertex, a parallelogram of\n",
      "twelve or thirteen inches in diagonal:--what are you to do with such a\n",
      "monster sticking fast in your house door?\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am insulting the intelligence of my Readers by accumulating\n",
      "details which must be patent to everyone who enjoys the advantages of a\n",
      "Residence in Spaceland.  Obviously the measurements of a single angle\n",
      "would no longer be sufficient under such portentous circumstances;\n",
      "one's whole life would be taken up in feeling or surveying the\n",
      "perimeter of one's acquaintances.  Already the difficulties of avoiding\n",
      "a collision in a crowd are enough to tax the sagacity of even a\n",
      "well-educated Square; but if no one could calculate the Regularity of a\n",
      "single figure in the company, all would be chaos and confusion, and the\n",
      "slightest panic would cause serious injuries, or--if there happened to\n",
      "be any Women or Soldiers present--perhaps considerable loss of life.\n",

      "wanting, it is true, some promulgators of paradoxes who maintain that\n",
      "there is no necessary connection between geometrical and moral\n",

      "assigning to the Women the same two colours as were assigned to the\n",
      "Priests, the Revolutionists thereby ensured that, in certain positions,\n",

      "imputed to them, and as to the consequent subversion of the\n",

      "From their earliest childhood, familiarized in their Circular\n",

      "\n",
      "As to the doctrine of the Circles it may briefly be summed up in a\n",
      "single maxim, \"Attend to your Configuration.\"  Whether political,\n",
      "ecclesiastical, or moral, all their teaching has for its object the\n",
      "improvement of individual and collective Configuration--with special\n",
      "reference of course to the Configuration of the Circles, to which all\n",
      "other objects are subordinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the merit of the Circles that they have effectually suppressed\n",
      "those ancient heresies which led men to waste energy and sympathy in\n",
      "the vain belief that conduct depends upon will, effort, training,\n",
      "encouragement, praise, or anything else but Configuration.  It was\n",
      "Pantocyclus--the illustrious Circle mentioned above, as the queller of\n",
      "the Colour Revolt--who first convinced mankind that Configuration makes\n",
      "the man; that if, for example, you are born an Isosceles with two\n",
      "uneven sides, you will assuredly go wrong unless you have them made\n",
      "even--for which purpose you must go to the Isosceles Hospital;\n",
      "similarly, if you are a Triangle, or Square, or even a Polygon, born\n",
      "with any Irregularity, you must be taken to one of the Regular\n",
      "Hospitals to have your disease cured; otherwise you will end your days\n",
      "in the State Prison or by the angle of the State Executioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "All faults or defects, from the slightest misconduct to the most\n",
      "flagitious crime, Pantocyclus attributed to some deviation from perfect\n",
      "Regularity in the bodily figure, caused perhaps (if not congenital) by\n",
      "some collision in a crowd; by neglect to take exercise, or by taking\n",
      "too much of it; or even by a sudden change of temperature, resulting in\n",
      "a shrinkage or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame.\n",
      "Therefore, concluded that illustrious Philosopher, neither good conduct\n",
      "nor bad conduct is a fit subject, in any sober estimation, for either\n",
      "praise or blame.  For why should you praise, for example, the integrity\n",
      "of a Square who faithfully defends the interests of his client, when\n",
      "you ought in reality rather to admire the exact precision of his right\n",
      "angles?  Or again, why blame a lying, thievish Isosceles, when you\n",
      "ought rather to deplore the incurable inequality of his sides?\n",
      "\n",
      "Theoretically, this doctrine is unquestionable; but it has practical\n",
      "drawbacks.  In dealing with an Isosceles, if a rascal pleads that he\n",
      "cannot help stealing because of his unevenness, you reply that for that\n",
      "very reason, because he cannot help being a nuisance to his neighbours,\n",
      "you, the Magistrate, cannot help sentencing him to be consumed--and\n",
      "there's an end of the matter.  But in little domestic difficulties,\n",
      "when the penalty of consumption, or death, is out of the question, this\n",
      "theory of Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly; and I must\n",
      "confess that occasionally when one of my own Hexagonal Grandsons pleads\n",
      "as an excuse for his disobedience that a sudden change of temperature\n",
      "has been too much for his Perimeter, and that I ought to lay the blame\n",
      "not on him but on his Configuration, which can only be strengthened by\n",

      "thinking so.  At all events I am not alone in my way of extricating\n",
      "myself from this dilemma; for I find that many of the highest Circles,\n",

      "when scolding their children, they speak about \"right\" and \"wrong\" as\n",

      "The weak point in the system of the Circles--if a humble Square may\n",

      "of some slight superiority of lustre, or because of the charms of a low\n",

      "\n",
      "Approaching one of the largest of what I thought to be Women, I\n",
      "accosted her, but received no answer.  A second and third appeal on my\n",

      "preserving questions I elicited the following facts:\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch--as he called himself--was\n",
      "persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom, and in\n",
      "which he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world, and\n",
      "indeed the whole of Space.  Not being able either to move or to see,\n",
      "save in his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it.\n",
      "Though he had heard my voice when I first addressed him, the sounds had\n",
      "come to him in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had made\n",
      "no answer, \"seeing no man,\" as he expressed it, \"and hearing a voice as\n",
      "it were from my own intestines.\"  Until the moment when I placed my\n",
      "mouth in his World, he had neither seen me, nor heard anything except\n",
      "confused sounds beating against, what I called his side, but what he\n",
      "called his INSIDE or STOMACH; nor had he even now the least conception\n",
      "of the region from which I had come.  Outside his World, or Line, all\n",
      "was a blank to him; nay, not even a blank, for a blank implies Space;\n",
      "say, rather, all was non-existent.\n",
      "\n",
      "His subjects--of whom the small Lines were men and the Points\n",
      "Women--were all alike confined in motion and eyesight to that single\n",
      "Straight Line, which was their World.  It need scarcely be added that\n",

      "it followed that no Linelander could ever pass another.  Once\n",

      "it was possible, amid circumstances so unfavourable to domestic\n",
      "relations, to enjoy the pleasures of conjugal union, I hesitated for\n",
      "some time to question his Royal Highness on so delicate a subject; but\n",
      "at last I plunged into it by abruptly inquiring as to the health of his\n",
      "family.  \"My wives and children,\" he replied, \"are well and happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Staggered at this answer--for in the immediate proximity of the Monarch\n",

      "\"How can you ask so absurd a question?\" replied the Monarch.  \"If it\n",

      "No, no; neighbourhood is needless for the union of hearts; and the\n",
      "birth of children is too important a matter to have been allowed to\n",
      "depend upon such an accident as proximity.  You cannot be ignorant of\n",

      "sends forth his richest, fullest, sweetest strain.  It is in this\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking that it was time to bring down the Monarch from his raptures\n",
      "to the level of common sense, I determined to endeavour to open up to\n",
      "him some glimpses of the truth, that is to say of the nature of things\n",
      "in Flatland.  So I began thus:  \"How does your Royal Highness\n",
      "distinguish the shapes and positions of his subjects?  I for my part\n",
      "noticed by the sense of sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some\n",
      "of your people are lines and others Points; and that some of the lines\n",
      "are larger--\"  \"You speak of an impossibility,\" interrupted the King;\n",
      "\"you must have seen a vision; for to detect the difference between a\n",
      "Line and a Point by the sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the\n",
      "nature of things, impossible; but it can be detected by the sense of\n",
      "hearing, and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained.\n",
      "Behold me--I am a Line, the longest in Lineland, over six inches of\n",
      "Space--\" \"Of Length,\" I ventured to suggest.  \"Fool,\" said he, \"Space\n",
      "is Length.  Interrupt me again, and I have done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I apologized; but he continued scornfully, \"Since you are impervious to\n",
      "argument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices I\n",
      "reveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment six thousand miles\n",
      "seventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one to the North, the\n",
      "other to the South.  Listen, I call to them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He chirruped, and then complacently continued:  \"My wives at this\n",
      "moment receiving the sound of one of my voice, closely followed by the\n",
      "other, and perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval in\n",
      "which sound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one of my mouths is\n",
      "6.457 inches further from them than the other, and accordingly know my\n",
      "shape to be 6.457 inches.  But you will of course understand that my\n",
      "wives do not make this calculation every time they hear my two voices.\n",
      "They made it, once for all, before we were married.  But they COULD\n",
      "make it at any time.  And in the same way I can estimate the shape of\n",

      "as the echo of the Northern?  May not such deceptions cause great\n",
      "inconvenience?  And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind\n",
      "by commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?\" This of\n",
      "course was a very stupid question, for feeling could not have answered\n",
      "the purpose; but I asked with the view of irritating the Monarch, and I\n",
      "succeeded perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" cried he in horror, \"explain your meaning.\"  \"Feel, touch, come\n",

      "liable to be shattered by such an approximation, must be preserved by\n",
      "the State; but since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of\n",
      "sight from Men, the Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman\n",

      "of deception, it is non-existent: for the Voice, being the essence of\n",
      "one's Being, cannot be thus changed at will.  But come, suppose that I\n",

      "billion, verifying the size and distance of each by the sense of\n",

      "discern, by sight, a Line from a Point.  And let me prove it.  Just\n",

      "and then from right to left, with Seven Men and a Woman in your\n",
      "immediate proximity on the left, and eight Men and two Women on your\n",

      "\n",

      "things, and then dreamed that you saw them.  And let me ask what you\n",
      "mean by those words 'left' and 'right.'  I suppose it is your way of\n",
      "saying Northward and Southward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so,\" replied I; \"besides your motion of Northward and Southward,\n",

      "I.  If you cannot tell your right side from your left, I fear that no\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "it not sometimes occur to you that you COULD move in some other way,\n",
      "turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which\n",
      "your side is now fronting?  In other words, instead of always moving in\n",
      "the direction of one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to\n",
      "move in the direction, so to speak, of your side?\n",
      "\n",
      "King.  Never.  And what do you mean?  How can a man's inside \"front\" in\n",
      "any direction?  Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?\n",
      "\n",
      "I.  Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds,\n",
      "and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire\n",
      "to indicate to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland.  As long as any\n",
      "part of me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King kept\n",
      "exclaiming, \"I see you, I see you still; you are not moving.\" But when\n",
      "I had at last moved myself out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest\n",
      "voice, \"She is vanished; she is dead.\"  \"I am not dead,\" replied I; \"I\n",
      "am simply out of Lineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line\n",
      "which you call Space, and in the true Space, where I can see things as\n",
      "they are.  And at this moment I can see your Line, or side--or inside\n",
      "as you are pleased to call it; and I can see also the Men and Women on\n",

      "order, their size, and the interval between each.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, \"Does that\n",

      "appear to have only one voice I have little doubt you are not a Man but\n",
      "a Woman--but, if you had a particle of sense, you would listen to\n",
      "reason.  You ask me to believe that there is another Line besides that\n",
      "which my senses indicate, and another motion besides that of which I am\n",
      "daily conscious.  I, in return, ask you to describe in words or\n",
      "indicate by motion that other Line of which you speak.  Instead of\n",
      "moving, you merely exercise some magic art of vanishing and returning\n",
      "to sight; and instead of any lucid description of your new World, you\n",

      "promising young Hexagon of unusual brilliancy and perfect angularity.\n",
      "His uncles and I had been giving him his usual practical lesson in\n",
      "Sight Recognition, turning ourselves upon our centres, now rapidly, now\n",
      "more slowly, and questioning him as to our positions; and his answers\n",
      "had been so satisfactory that I had been induced to reward him by\n",
      "giving him a few hints on Arithmetic, as applied to Geometry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking nine Squares, each an inch every way, I had put them together so\n",
      "as to make one large Square, with a side of three inches, and I had\n",
      "hence proved to my little Grandson that--though it was impossible for\n",
      "us to SEE the inside of the Square--yet we might ascertain the number\n",
      "of square inches in a Square by simply squaring the number of inches in\n",
      "the side:  \"and thus,\" said I, \"we know that three-to-the-second, or\n",

      "it mean?\"  \"Nothing at all,\" replied I, \"not at least in Geometry; for\n",
      "Geometry has only Two Dimensions.\"  And then I began to shew the boy\n",
      "how a Point by moving through a length of three inches makes a Line of\n",
      "three inches, which may be represented by three; and how a Line of\n",
      "three inches, moving parallel to itself through a length of three\n",
      "inches, makes a Square of three inches every way, which may be\n",
      "represented by three-to-the-second.  xxx Upon this, my Grandson, again\n",
      "returning to his former suggestion, took me up rather suddenly and\n",
      "exclaimed, \"Well, then, if a Point by moving three inches, makes a Line\n",
      "of three inches represented by three; and if a straight Line of three\n",
      "inches, moving parallel to itself, makes a Square of three inches every\n",

      "three inches every way, moving somehow parallel to itself (but I don't\n",

      "Straight Line, and only of One Dimension.  No, no, my Lord; we Squares\n",
      "are better advised, and are as well aware of your Lordship that a\n",
      "Woman, though popularly called a Straight Line, is, really and\n",

      "long.  We see her length, we infer her breadth; which, though very\n",
      "slight, is capable of measurement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stranger.  You do not understand me.  I mean that when you see a Woman,\n",
      "you ought--besides inferring her breadth--to see her length, and to SEE\n",
      "what we call her HEIGHT; although the last Dimension is infinitesimal\n",
      "in your country.  If a Line were mere length without \"height,\" it would\n",

      "recognize this?\n",
      "\n",
      "I.  I must indeed confess that I do not in the least understand your\n",
      "Lordship.  When we in Flatland see a Line, we see length and\n",
      "BRIGHTNESS.  If the brightness disappears, the Line is extinguished,\n",
      "and, as you say, ceases to occupy Space.  But am I to suppose that your\n",
      "Lordship gives the brightness the title of a Dimension, and that what\n",
      "we call \"bright\" you call \"high\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "Stranger.  No, indeed.  By \"height\" I mean a Dimension like your\n",
      "length: only, with you, \"height\" is not so easily perceptible, being\n",
      "extremely small.\n",
      "\n",
      "I.  My Lord, your assertion is easily put to the test.  You say I have\n",
      "a Third Dimension, which you call \"height.\"  Now, Dimension implies\n",
      "direction and measurement.  Do but measure my \"height,\" or merely\n",
      "indicate to me the direction in which my \"height\" extends, and I will\n",
      "become your convert.  Otherwise, your Lordship's own understand must\n",
      "hold me excused.\n",

      "Stranger.  (TO HIMSELF.)  I can do neither.  How shall I convince him?\n",

      "everything else in Flatland, they have no tops or bottom) full of\n",
      "money; I see also two tablets of accounts.  I am about to descend into\n",
      "that cupboard and to bring you one of those tablets.  I saw you lock\n",
      "the cupboard half an hour ago, and I know you have the key in your\n",
      "possession.  But I descend from Space; the doors, you see, remain\n",
      "unmoved.  Now I am in the cupboard and am taking the tablet.  Now I\n",
      "have it.  Now I ascend with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rushed to the closet and dashed the door open.  One of the tablets\n",
      "was gone.  With a mocking laugh, the Stranger appeared in the other\n",
      "corner of the room, and at the same time the tablet appeared upon the\n",
      "floor.  I took it up.  There could be no doubt--it was the missing\n",

      "the Stranger continued:  \"Surely you must now see that my explanation,\n",
      "and no other, suits the phenomena.  What you call Solid things are\n",
      "really superficial; what you call Space is really nothing but a great\n",
      "Plane.  I am in Space, and look down upon the insides of the things of\n",
      "which you only see the outsides.  You could leave the Plane yourself,\n",

      "in their several apartments; now I see the inside of the Theatre, ten\n",
      "doors off, from which the audience is only just departing; and on the\n",
      "other side a Circle in his study, sitting at his books.  Now I shall\n",
      "come back to you.  And, as a crowning proof, what do you say to my\n",
      "giving you a touch, just the least touch, in your stomach?  It will not\n",
      "seriously injure you, and the slight pain you may suffer cannot be\n",
      "compared with the mental benefit you will receive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I could utter a word of remonstrance, I felt a shooting pain in\n",
      "my inside, and a demoniacal laugh seemed to issue from within me.  A\n",
      "moment afterwards the sharp agony had ceased, leaving nothing but a\n",
      "dull ache behind, and the Stranger began to reappear, saying, as he\n",
      "gradually increased in size, \"There, I have not hurt you much, have I?\n",

      "lay open to my view:  yet I could see no heart, lungs, nor arteries,\n",
      "only a beautiful harmonious Something--for which I had no words; but\n",
      "you, my Readers in Spaceland, would call it the surface of the Sphere.\n",

      "Prostrating myself mentally before my Guide, I cried, \"How is it, O\n",

      "\"What you think you see, you see not,\" he replied; \"it is not giving to\n",

      "PREFACE TO THE SECOND AND REVISED EDITION, 1884.  BY THE EDITOR\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If my poor Flatland friend retained the vigour of mind which he enjoyed\n",
      "when he began to compose these Memoirs, I should not now need to\n",
      "represent him in this preface, in which he desires, fully, to return\n",
      "his thanks to his readers and critics in Spaceland, whose appreciation\n",
      "has, with unexpected celerity, required a second edition of this work;\n",
      "secondly, to apologize for certain errors and misprints (for which,\n",
      "however, he is not entirely responsible); and, thirdly, to explain one\n",
      "or two misconceptions.  But he is not the Square he once was.  Years of\n",
      "imprisonment, and the still heavier burden of general incredulity and\n",
      "mockery, have combined with the thoughts and notions, and much also of\n",
      "the terminology, which he acquired during his short stay in spaceland.\n",
      "He has, therefore, requested me to reply in his behalf to two special\n",
      "objections, one of an intellectual, the other of a moral nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first objection is, that a Flatlander, seeing a Line, sees\n",
      "something that must be THICK to the eye as well as LONG to the eye\n",
      "(otherwise it would not be visible, if it had not some thickness); and\n",
      "consequently he ought (it is argued) to acknowledge that his countrymen\n",
      "are not only long and broad, but also (though doubtless to a very\n",
      "slight degree) THICK or HIGH.  This objection is plausible, and, to\n",
      "Spacelanders, almost irresistible, so that, I confess, when I first\n",
      "heard it, I knew not what to reply.  But my poor old friend's answer\n",
      "appears to me completely to meet it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I admit,\" said he--when I mentioned to him this objection--\"I admit\n",
      "the truth of your critic's facts, but I deny his conclusions.  It is\n",
      "true that we have really in Flatland a Third unrecognized Dimension\n",
      "called 'height,' just as it also is true that you have really in\n",
      "Spaceland a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, called by no name at\n",
      "present, but which I will call 'extra-height.'  But we can no more take\n",
      "cognizance of our 'height' than you can of your 'extra-height.'  Even\n",
      "I--who have been in Spaceland, and have had the privilege of\n",
      "understanding for twenty-four hours the meaning of 'height'--even I\n",
      "cannot now comprehend it, nor realize it by the sense of sight or by\n",
      "any process of reason; I can but apprehend it by faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The reason is obvious.  Dimension implies direction, implies\n",
      "measurement, implies the more and the less.  Now, all our lines are\n",
      "EQUALLY and INFINITESIMALLY thick (or high, whichever you like);\n",
      "consequently, there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the\n",
      "conception of that Dimension.  No 'delicate micrometer'--as has been\n",
      "suggested by one too hasty Spaceland critic--would in the least avail\n",
      "us; for we should not know WHAT TO MEASURE, NOR IN WHAT DIRECTION.\n",
      "When we see a Line, we see something that is long and BRIGHT;\n",
      "BRIGHTNESS, as well as length, is necessary to the existence of a Line;\n",
      "if the brightness vanishes, the Line is extinguished.  Hence, all my\n",
      "Flatland friends--when I talk to them about the unrecognized Dimension\n",
      "which is somehow visible in a Line--say, 'Ah, you mean BRIGHTNESS': and\n",
      "when I reply, 'No, I mean a real Dimension,' they at once retort, 'Then\n",
      "measure it, or tell us in what direction it extends'; and this silences\n",
      "me, for I can do neither.  Only yesterday, when the Chief Circle (in\n",
      "other words our High Priest) came to inspect the State Prison and paid\n",
      "me his seventh annual visit, and when for the seventh time he put me\n",
      "the question, 'Was I any better?'  I tried to prove to him that he was\n",
      "'high,' as well as long and broad, although he did not know it.  But\n",
      "what was his reply?  'You say I am \"high\"; measure my \"high-ness\" and I\n",
      "will believe you.'  What could I do?  How could I meet his challenge?\n",
      "I was crushed; and he left the room triumphant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does this still seem strange to you?  Then put yourself in a similar\n",
      "position.  Suppose a person of the Fourth Dimension, condescending to\n",
      "visit you, were to say, 'Whenever you open your eyes, you see a Plane\n",
      "(which is of Two Dimensions) and you INFER a Solid (which is of Three);\n",
      "but in reality you also see (though you do not recognize) a Fourth\n",
      "Dimension, which is not colour nor brightness nor anything of the kind,\n",
      "but a true Dimension, although I cannot point out to you its direction,\n",
      "nor can you possibly measure it.' What would you say to such a visitor?\n",
      "Would not you have him locked up?  Well, that is my fate:  and it is as\n",
      "natural for us Flatlanders to lock up a Square for preaching the Third\n",
      "Dimension, as it is for you Spacelanders to lock up a Cube for\n",
      "preaching the Fourth.  Alas, how strong a family likeness runs through\n",
      "blind and persecuting humanity in all Dimensions!  Points, Lines,\n",
      "Squares, Cubes, Extra-Cubes--we are all liable to the same errors, all\n",
      "alike the Slaves of our respective Dimensional prejudices, as one of\n",
      "our Spaceland poets has said--\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On this point the defence of the Square seems to me to be impregnable.\n",
      "I wish I could say that his answer to the second (or moral) objection\n",
      "was equally clear and cogent.  It has been objected that he is a\n",
      "woman-hater; and as this objection has been vehemently urged by those\n",
      "whom Nature's decree has constituted the somewhat larger half of the\n",
      "Spaceland race, I should like to remove it, so far as I can honestly do\n",
      "so.  But the Square is so unaccustomed to the use of the moral\n",
      "terminology of Spaceland that I should be doing him an injustice if I\n",
      "were literally to transcribe his defence against this charge.  Acting,\n",
      "therefore, as his interpreter and summarizer, I gather that in the\n",
      "course of an imprisonment of seven years he has himself modified his\n",
      "own personal views, both as regards Women and as regards the Isosceles\n",
      "or Lower Classes.  Personally, he now inclines to the opinion of the\n",
      "Sphere (see page 86) that the Straight Lines are in many important\n",
      "respects superior to the Circles.  But, writing as a Historian, he has\n",
      "identified himself (perhaps too closely) with the views generally\n",
      "adopted by Flatland, and (as he has been informed) even by Spaceland,\n",
      "Historians; in whose pages (until very recent times) the destinies of\n",
      "Women and of the masses of mankind have seldom been deemed worthy of\n",
      "mention and never of careful consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a still more obscure passage he now desires to disavow the Circular\n",
      "or aristocratic tendencies with which some critics have naturally\n",
      "credited him.  While doing justice to the intellectual power with which\n",
      "a few Circles have for many generations maintained their supremacy over\n",
      "immense multitudes of their countrymen, he believes that the facts of\n",
      "Flatland, speaking for themselves without comment on his part, declare\n",
      "that Revolutions cannot always be suppressed by slaughter, and that\n",
      "Nature, in sentencing the Circles to infecundity, has condemned them to\n",
      "ultimate failure--\"and herein,\" he says, \"I see a fulfilment of the\n",
      "great Law of all worlds, that while the wisdom of Man thinks it is\n",
      "working one thing, the wisdom of Nature constrains it to work another,\n",
      "and quite a different and far better thing.\" For the rest, he begs his\n",
      "readers not to suppose that every minute detail in the daily life of\n",
      "Flatland must needs correspond to some other detail in Spaceland; and\n",
      "yet he hopes that, taken as a whole, his work may prove suggestive as\n",
      "well as amusing, to those Spacelanders of moderate and modest minds\n",
      "who--speaking of that which is of the highest importance, but lies\n",
      "beyond experience--decline to say on the one hand, \"This can never be,\"\n",
